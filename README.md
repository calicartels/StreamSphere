## Introduction

Welcome to Stream Sphere, this is an Video Streaming application, similar to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Apple TV+ and more more. The admin will have the whole control of everything that happens in the environment. The Admin Panel provide features to view users, when they joined with graphical view in a graph(Analytics), delete, and latest joined members. The admin can only upload movies and series for the users to stream, and select the list its supposed to show. Later can edit any movie and the list itself. The Admin can only be created thorugh the database direct interaction by DB Administrator.

Then the users, can create account and login to view the movies and series uploaded by admin. Just by adding a payment gateway as a middleware between login and admin pages, we can make this subscription based video streaming service. The goal of this application is to get an understanding of how an entire software development management system works end to end.
